This program has two main classes which can be run:
App.java and SmartApp.java

Running App.java will provide you with a text based interface with which you can enter the file path of the graph, and then select an algorithm to run.

SmartApp.java is the program submitted as a jar file for the tournament. It contains more logic for deciding which algorithms to run (and in which order), and thus does not let you choose which algorithm you want to run.
